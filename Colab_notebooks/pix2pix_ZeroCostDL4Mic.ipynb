        "<font size = 4>pix2pix is a deep-learning method allowing image-to-image translation from one image domain type to another image domain type. It was first published by [Isola *et al.* in 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004). The image transformation requires paired images for training (supervised learning) and is made possible here by using a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture to use information from the input image and obtain the equivalent translated image.\n",
