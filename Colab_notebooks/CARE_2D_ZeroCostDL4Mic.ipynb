The CARE network uses a U-Net network architecture and allows image restoration and resolution improvement in 2D and 3D images, in a supervised manner, using noisy images as input and low-noise images as targets for training. The function of the network is essentially determined by the set of images provided in the training dataset.

After this point no further training is required. If the **Validation loss** suddenly increases again an the **Training loss** simultaneously goes towards zero, it means that the network is overfitting to the training data.
