Note that the curves can look flat towards the right side, just because of the y-axis scaling. The network has reached convergence once the curves flatten out. After this point no further training is required. If the **validation loss** suddenly increases again an the **loss** simultaneously goes towards zero, it means that the network is overfitting to the training data. In other words the network is remembering the exact patterns from the training data and no longer generalizes well to unseen data. In this case the training dataset has to be increased."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"vMzSP50kMv5p","colab_type":"code","cellView":"form","colab":{}},"source":["#@markdown ##Play the cell to show a plot of training errors vs. epoch number\n","import csv\n","from matplotlib import pyplot as plt\n","\n","lossDataFromCSV = []\n","vallossDataFromCSV = []\n","\n","with open(QC_model_path+'/'+QC_model_name+'/Quality Control/training_evaluation.csv','r') as csvfile:\n","    csvRead = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=',')\n","    next(csvRead)\n","    for row in csvRead:\n","        lossDataFromCSV.append(float(row[0]))\n","        vallossDataFromCSV.append(float(row[1]))\n","\n","epochNumber = range(len(lossDataFromCSV))\n","plt.figure(figsize=(16,5))\n","\n","plt.plot(epochNumber,lossDataFromCSV, label='Training loss')\n","plt.plot(epochNumber,vallossDataFromCSV, label='Validation loss')\n","plt.title('Training loss and validation loss vs. epoch number')\n","plt.ylabel('Loss')\n","plt.xlabel('Epoh number')\n","plt.legend()\n","plt.savefig(QC_model_path+'/'+QC_model_name+'/Quality Control/lossCurvePlots.png')\n","plt.show()\n","\n"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"biT9FI9Ri77_","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## **5.2.
