    "<font size = 4>**StarDist 3D** is a deep-learning method that can be used to segment cell nuclei from 3D bioimages and was first published by [Weigert *et al.* in 2019 on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03636), extending to 3D the 2D appraoch from [Schmidt *et al.* in 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03535). It uses a shape representation based on star-convex polygons for nuclei in an image to predict the presence and the shape of these nuclei. This StarDist 3D network is based on an adapted ResNet network architecture.\n",

After this point no further training is required. If the **Validation loss** suddenly increases again an the **Training loss** simultaneously goes towards zero, it means that the network is overfitting to the training data. In other words the network is remembering the exact patterns from the training data and no longer generalizes well to unseen data. In this case the training dataset has to be increased.\n"
