        "<font size = 4>**Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network** (WGAN) is an alternative to traditional GAN training, it was published by [Arjovsky, Martin and Chintala, Soumith and Bottou, Leon](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/arjovsky17a/arjovsky17a.pdf). This network aims to recover a high-resolution (HR) image from a low-resolution (LR) image and in order to achieve it, a new loss function is proposed: Wasserstein distance or Earth Mover's Distance. They claim a better stability of learning wich is one of the main problems in GAN training.\n",

After this point no further training is required. If the **Validation loss** suddenly increases again an the **Training loss** simultaneously goes towards zero, it means that the network is overfitting to the training data. In other words the network is remembering the exact patterns from the training data and no longer generalizes well to unseen data. In this case the training dataset has to be increased."
