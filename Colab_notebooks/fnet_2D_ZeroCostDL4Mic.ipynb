        "Label-free prediction (fnet) is a neural network developped to infer the distribution of specific cellular structures from label-free images such as brightfield or EM images. It was first published in 2018 by [Ounkomol *et al.* in Nature Methods](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0111-2). The network uses a common U-Net architecture and is trained using paired imaging volumes from the same field of view, imaged in a label-free (e.g. brightfield) and labelled condition (e.g. fluorescence images of a specific label of interest). When trained, this allows the user to identify certain structures from brightfield images alone. The performance of fnet may depend significantly on the structure at hand.\n",
