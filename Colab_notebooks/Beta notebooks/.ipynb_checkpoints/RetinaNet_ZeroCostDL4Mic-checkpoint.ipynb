    "<font size = 4> RetinaNet is a deep-learning network designed to perform object detection and classification of objects in images, published by [Tsung-Yi Lin, Priya Goyal, Ross Girshick, Kaiming He, Piotr Dollár](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002). \n",
    "It is trained on images with class annotations in the form of bounding boxes drawn around the objects of interest. RetinaNet is a single, unified network composed of a backbone network and two task-specific subnetworks. The backbone is responsible for computing a convolutional feature map over an entire input image and is an off-the-self convolution network. The first subnet performs classification on the backbones output; the second subnet performs convolution bounding box regression. Aplying this mechanic, RetinaNet learns classification and object detection simultaneously by taking the whole input image into account, predicting many possible bounding box solutions, and then using regression to find the best bounding boxes and classifications for each object.\n",
