After this point no further training is required. If the **Validation loss** suddenly increases again an the **Training loss** simultaneously goes towards zero, it means that the network is overfitting to the training data. In other words the network is remembering the exact noise patterns from the training data and no longer generalizes well to unseen data. In this case the training dataset has to be increased."
