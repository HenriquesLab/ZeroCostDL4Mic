        "<font size = 4> YOLOv2 is a deep-learning method designed to perform object detection and classification of objects in images, published by [Redmon and Farhadi](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8100173). This is based on the original [YOLO](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640) implementation published by the same authors. YOLOv2 is trained on images with class annotations in the form of bounding boxes drawn around the objects of interest. The images are downsampled by a convolutional neural network (CNN) and objects are classified in two final fully connected layers in the network. YOLOv2 learns classification and object detection simultaneously by taking the whole input image into account, predicting many possible bounding box solutions, and then using regression to find the best bounding boxes and classifications for each object.\n",

After this point no further training is required. If the **Validation loss** suddenly increases again an the **Training loss** simultaneously goes towards zero, it means that the network is overfitting to the training data. In other words the network is remembering the exact patterns from the training data and no longer generalizes well to unseen data. In this case the training dataset has to be increased."
